          <h2>Gerrymandering and Justice Kennedy's "Hackathon Pitch"</h2>
          <p>
          <strong>In <i><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieth_v._Jubelirer'>Vieth v. Jubelirer (2004)</a></i></strong>, the Supreme Court declined to intervene in the redistricting of
          Pennsylvania's Congressional districts. Racially discriminatory gerrymandering has been struck down by the
          Supreme Court many times, but the Court could not find a formula for evaluating <em>partisan gerrymandering</em> - disenfranchising voters of a political party.</p>
          <p><strong>The 2010 census</strong> determined new Congressional districts for the 2012 election.
          In an election where a slim majority (50.28%) of Pennsylvania's popular vote was for Democratic candidates, Republicans
          won thirteen seats to Democrats' five. The parties continued to win the same districts in 2014 and 2016 (mapped below).

          <h2>Justice Kennedy's opinion</h2>
          <p><strong>The plurality opinion</strong> avoiding action on Pennsylvania's districts was written by Justice Antonin Scalia. A <a href='https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-1580.ZC.html'>concurring (but optimistic) opinion</a> was written by frequent swing-voter Justice Anthony Kennedy:</p>
          <blockquote>
         "Technology is both a threat and a promiseâ€¦ On the one hand, if courts refuse to entertain any claims of partisan gerrymandering, the temptation to use partisan favoritism in districting in an unconstitutional manner will grow. On the other hand, <strong>new technologies may produce new methods of analysis that make more evident the precise nature of the burdens gerrymanders impose on the representational rights of voters and parties</strong>. That would facilitate court efforts to identify and remedy the burdens, with judicial intervention limited by the derived standards.
          <br/><br/>
If suitable standards with which to measure the burden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights did emerge, hindsight would show that the Court prematurely abandoned the field."
          </blockquote>
          <p>Since then, there's been an ongoing discussion about what might be a good test to
          show unconstitutionally unfair districts. <strong>We can expect this to be a major issue</strong> as
          we get closer to the 2020 Census. I'm going to show you two of the best methods:</p>

          <h3>Partisan Symmetry</h3>
          <hr/>
          <p>Partisan symmetry doesn't expect perfectly proportional representation in Congress. It tests whether
          if the parties were to switch statewide vote totals, they would also switch seat totals.</p>
          <p>In an ideal
          system, the parties would have equal representation at 50% and mirror each others achievements as their
          vote total rose. Using the same data as the map at the top of the page, we can predict that Democrats would need around 56% of the vote to win just 7 of Pennsylvania's
          15 contested Congressional elections.</p>

          <h3>Efficiency Gap</h3>
          <hr/>
          <p>Also called <i>wasted votes</i> - this method counts up votes of a recent election with over-representation in 'packed' districts and lost votes in 'cracked' districts, to show how a popular-vote-majority for one party is being diluted. This expects a model of hyper-proportionality (a party with a 2% lead would have 4% more seats, a 5% lead meaning 10% more seats, etc).</p>

          <p>By this metric, the Democrats lost more votes than the Republicans in all but two contested districts.
          Even other districts that they won count against them, because the Democratic candidates received so much
          more than 50% of the vote.</p>

          <h3>Other methods</h3>
          <hr/>
          <p>Another two interesting methods (which I might demo here in the future) are:
          <h4>Compactness</h4>
          <p>When most people think of gerrymandering, they point to unusually-shaped districts as examples of shady redistricting gone amok. <a href='http://redistricting.lls.edu/where-state.php#compactness'>Multiple states</a> require their districts to be <em>geometrically compact</em>, by comparing the edges or area of the shape to a simplified ideal. You could compare the shape to a circle of the same area, or the smallest circle which encloses the district, or a convex polygon.</p>
          <p>Many unusually-shaped districts, such as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois%27s_4th_congressional_district'>Illinois's 4th District</a> are created as
          majority-minority districts, to better represent minority groups in Congress. These were created and continue
          to be protected by the Voting Rights Act (it's a separate section from the rules struck down in 
          2013 by <i><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_County_v._Holder'>Shelby County v. Holder</a></i>).</p>
          <p>The general consensus is that compactness could be a helpful standard in redistricting, but it can't be the
          only factor that's considered. You can read more about <a href='http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jowei/florida.pdf'>how compactness can still cause 'unintentional gerrymandering' [PDF]</a> and how <a href='http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/5/12/1384062/-Compactness-is-a-terrible-standard-for-redistricting-and-determining-if-maps-were-gerrymandered'>purely computer-drawn lines can be discriminatory</a>.</p>
          <h4>Random simulations</h4>
          <p>A computer can generate many thousands of redistricting maps, and show that the state's chosen map is multiple
          standard deviations more partisan when compared to its alternatives. You can see examples of how this could be applied in <a href='http://mike.teczno.com/notes/redistricting/random-wisconsin-plans.html'>Wisconsin</a> and in <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/opinion/sunday/its-the-geography-stupid.html?_r=0'>national maps</a>.
